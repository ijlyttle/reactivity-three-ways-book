# Preface {.unnumbered}

The purpose of this book is to show how to implement reactive data-science apps using three languages/frameworks:

-   R: [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
-   Python: [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
-   JavaScript: [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/five-minute-introduction)

An example app is created for each framework, where you can:

 - upload a data-frame as CSV, using [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) as default.
   - show as a table.
   - download as CSV.
 - specify grouping columns, aggregation columns, and an aggregation function.
 - create an aggregated data-frame from the input, using the specification.
   - show as a table.
   - download as CSV.
 
 For Shiny, here's the [app](https://ijlyttle.shinyapps.io/aggregate-local) and the [code](https://github.com/ijlyttle/reactivity-demo-shiny).
 
 For Dash, here's the [app](https://aggregate-local.herokuapp.com) and the [code](https://github.com/ijlyttle/reactivity-demo-dash).
 
 For Observable, the [app is the code](https://observablehq.com/@ijlyttle/aggregate-local).
